# Cytoplasm Change Log

This document contains the complete change log for every official release of
Cytoplasm. It is intended to be updated with every commit that makes a user-facing
change worth reporting in the change log. As such, it changes frequently between
releases. Final change log entries are published as [Releases](releases).

## v0.4.1

### Tools

#### `j2s`

- Added an option to allow additional fields in structures and ignore them in
encoding and decoding. Note that additional fields are totally untouched&mdash;they
are not even initialized to a default value.

## v0.4.0

**Released on November 1, 2023**

This is the first independent release of Cytoplasm! Last month, Cytoplasm was
split off of [Telodendria](/Telodendria/Telodendria) to become its own independent
project with its own independent releases. This allows it to develop at a much more
rapid pace than Telodendria.

Changes in future releases will be reported here. Since this is the first release,
there are no changes to show.
